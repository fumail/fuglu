Developers: 
 * suspect.addheader() has a new 'immediate' option to make headers visible for consecutive plugins. by default, headers are only added before re-injecting
 * Spamassassin Plugin: writes new tag "SAPlugin.skipreason' if the message was not scanned
 * new way of defining required config variables. plugins can now provide defaults and config option descriptions. 
   see: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/fuglu/wiki/dev/WritingPlugins#definingconfigurationoptionsforyourplugin
   important: for default values to work, make sure your plugin doesn't read it's own config values in __init__ !
 * Suspect.getSource() now has an optional maxsize parameter to limit the amount of body data read into memory
 * new development tool: 'plugdummy.py', dry-run and debug your plugins without a running fuglu

 * started changelog ;-)
 * bugfix: Milter protocol errors
 * bugfix: Incorrect unquoting of two leading dots in smtp transactions could lead to broken s/mime sigs
 * A few plugins now have a 'PROBLEMACTION' so it is now configurable if a message should be deferred or accepted if for example the clamav daemon is not reachable
 * new option: [main] trashlog (boolean), default False, if True, Fuglu writes a 00-fuglutrash.log file in the trashdir listing all deleted messages
 * SuspectFilters (previously 'HeaderFilters'): 
 	* now supports header wildcard (Character '*')
 	* accepts colon at the end
 	* alias "from_address" for envelope_from and "to_address" for envelope_to
 	* new type: 'mime:<headername>' to check mime headers in all attachments
 	* new type: 'body:stripped'  (or just 'body') to match all text parts with html tags removed and newlines replaced by space
 	* new type: 'body:raw' to match the decoded body in all text/* parts
 	* new type: 'body:full' to match the full undecoded body

 	* new option "forwardoriginal" -> Does forward the original message source to the next plugin, without modified SA-Headers

Developers:
 * Suspects now also have a "highspam" tag which allows different behavior based on whether a message is "probably" or "definitely" spam
