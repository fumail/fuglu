   see: http://gryphius.github.io/fuglu/configuration-index.html#fetching-scan-time-configuration-values-from-a-database

Developers:
 * plugdummy.py has new options (show default plugin config, lint plugin)

   see: http://gryphius.github.io/fuglu/plugins-index.html#define-configuration-options-for-your-plugin
